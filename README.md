# buffr-downloads

SQLite-backed downloads store for buffr.

Part of the [buffr](https://github.com/kryptic-sh/buffr) ecosystem — a
vim-inspired, CEF-backed browser written in Rust. This crate is pulled into the
umbrella as a git submodule under `crates/buffr-downloads/`; consumers outside the
umbrella can depend on it directly:

```toml
[dependencies]
buffr-downloads = "0.1"
```

## Status
